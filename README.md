# OpsFolio Penetration Toolkit
Welcome to OpsFolio Penetration Toolkit. Our toolkit comprises a comprehensive set of penetration testing tools, including Nmap and more, designed to assess the security posture of networks and endpoints. With scheduled GitHub Actions, our toolkit automatically runs on GitHub-managed remote runners, enabling seamless testing of IP addresses or endpoints defined in GitHub Action variables/secrets.

## Key Features
- Automated Testing: Scheduled GitHub Actions facilitate regular testing without manual intervention.
- Toolset: Our toolkit includes popular tools like Nmap for network discovery and security auditing.
- Centralized Reporting: Leveraging the Nmap-formatter, our toolkit combines XML outputs from each endpoint and aggregates results into a single SQLite database.
- Querying Capabilities: The aggregated data in the SQLite database allows for efficient querying using SQL, enabling in-depth analysis and reporting.

### Configuring Variables in GitHub
To configure variables for the namp pentesting workflow in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Select **Variables**, then click on `New repository variable`.
4. `Name` the variable **ENDPOINTS**.
5. Enter the `value` in the format `hostname|ipaddress|boundary`. 

For example:
```bash
DO_PRIME|19x.xx.xx.x7|DigitalOcean
```
6. Click on Add variable.

You can add any number of IP addresses in this format, which means there is no need to hardcode the hostnames, IP addresses, or boundary names in the code.


### Manual Workflow Execution
To run the workflow manually, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the **workflow** you want to run from the list of workflows.
3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right side of the screen.
4. If your workflow requires inputs, provide the necessary variables or parameters.
5. Confirm by clicking the **Run workflow** button in the modal that appears.
