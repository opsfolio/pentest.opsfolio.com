# OpsFolio Penetration Toolkit

Welcome to OpsFolio Penetration Toolkit. Our toolkit comprises a comprehensive set of penetration testing tools, including Nmap and more, designed to assess the security posture of networks and endpoints. With scheduled GitHub Actions, our toolkit automatically runs on GitHub-managed remote runners, enabling seamless testing of IP addresses or endpoints defined in GitHub Action variables/secrets.

# Key Features

   - Automated Testing: Scheduled GitHub Actions facilitate regular testing without manual intervention.
   - Toolset: Our toolkit includes popular tools like Nmap for network discovery and security auditing.
   - Centralized Reporting: Leveraging the Nmap-formatter, our toolkit combines XML outputs from each endpoint and aggregates results into a single SQLite database.
   - Querying Capabilities: The aggregated data in the SQLite database allows for efficient querying using SQL, enabling in-depth analysis and reporting.

Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to our toolkit as we continue to enhance security testing capabilities for OpsFolio users!
